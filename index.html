        <h3>High flying bird </h3>
        <p>⁣ High Flying Bird isn't your conventional Basketball movie. Sure it talks about it, but not one proper game is played during its 90 minute runtime as Ray Burke, a sports agent, sets out to bring an end to a lockout - a complete shutdown to be precise, if team owners and players fail to come to an agreement about payment conditions - all within a time frame of 72 hours. ⁣</p>

        <h3>Gnatz: O</h3>
        <p>Not a continuation from the original series but this event did takes place in the manga. So consider it as a soft reboot from the anime. Still good tho. Huge fan of the original manga (But not the ending as it was rushed and became weirder).
            This movie on the other hand, slightly different than what i read and definitely not a continuation of the Gantz (2004) anime series as they changed the ending on it but the plot of this movie was actually same from the manga itself (just the timeline was a bit off). Consider it as a soft reboot from the original anime series. 
            Love the quality of the anime, the cgi technology matched perfectly with the aesthetics and mood setup of this franschise. Great world building (modernised as compared to the series and manga). Very reminiscent of the Final fantasy and Resident Evil animated movies. Very hyper realistic and such an eye candy for SciFi lovers. The action scenes were great and love the gores. In fact, just too many actions with zero story progression. Regardless, awesome scores and sound effects. The original song was fine but the voice castings were terrific. A well deserving act by the casts. Few issues that i had with this movie, the mouth movement of the characters doesnt meet the speech timing and this franschise never get the female characters right, theyre always potrayed as the love interest for the main characters, weak with sobbing moments. 
            They reuse the same characters and concept just like in the manga after the tragedy from 'Kurono Alien' arc. But the timeline didnt add up with the manga. They added more of the intense action scenes and hyped up the stakes and drama. The monsters were indeed terrifying to look at, the same reason why i loved the manga. I didnt expect the TRON-esque neon blue lightings on the techs, suits and vehicles since the manga wasnt colored, which was a nice shock. The gantz sphere can talk finally. Not recommended for younger auduences due to violences and nuduty.</p>

        <h3>The Seven Deadly Sins Cursed by light</h3>
        <p>This movie is good but not great. Although I miss Escanor here badly. I like new characters such as Second Fairy King Dahlia who appeared for the first time and Giant Craftsman Dubs (his name was mentioned by Lady of the Lake in Dragon's Judgement) but this is first time he appeared in flesh. I like them more than Bellion & Six Knights of Black. That's a different story that this movie is given lesser ratings (6.4/10) than Prisoner of the Sky (7.1/10) by IMDB.</p>
